# - Finds OpenMP support
# This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler.
# If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with
# openmp support are set.
#
# This module was modified from the standard FindOpenMP module to find Fortran
# flags.
#
# The following variables are set:
# OpenMP_Fortran_FLAGS - flags to add to the Fortran compiler for OpenMP
# support. In general, you must use these at both
# compile- and link-time.
# OMP_NUM_PROCS - the max number of processors available to OpenMP
